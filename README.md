Site published with GitHub Pages.

This repository contains a single-page site (index.html) at the repository root. Changes to the site are published when committed to the `main` branch.

Notes:
- Added a `.nojekyll` file to ensure GitHub Pages serves the site files as-is (bypass Jekyll).
- If you want a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file containing your domain and configure DNS accordingly.
